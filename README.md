## API Keys

Some of the APIs used by saminfoga require API keys. You can obtain free API keys from the following websites:

- Telnyx (for reverse phone number lookup): https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/anonymous-phone-number-lookup/lookup-phone-numbers

After obtaining the API keys, add them to the `config.json` file in the following format:

```json
{
  "telnyx_api_key": "your_telnyx_api_key",
  "numverify_api_key": "your_numverify_api_key",
  "ipgeolocation_api_key": "your_ipgeolocation_api_key"
}
```
